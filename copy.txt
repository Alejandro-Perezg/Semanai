Some time ago my FPS dropped to 59.437 and i immediately started feeling sick. It was like i was getting stabbed in the eyes, so horrible was the pain i experienced. I quickly shut off my pc before the seizures would start. I don't think i would have been quick enough if i wasn't properly trained in reaction skills. I don't think i would have made it if i was used to controllers instead of the superior mouse and keyboard. So PC gaming basically saved my life.

Anyways, i ordered a new graphics card and monitor (i broke it when i shut off the pc) from Amazon and then i had to wait a FULL day before it arrived, it was already pretty late (or pretty early for the casuals if you get what i mean) when i ordered the products. I used that time to go to the doctor to have my eyes checked out. Had to make sure there was no permanent damage. The doctor told me my eyes were fine and also that your eyes cant tell the difference between 60 and 59.437 fps, so i knew he was a console peasant. To make things worse, the asshole had to comment on my weight and said it wasn't normal for a 26 year old man to be wheezing from walking from the waiting room to the examination room. I told the peasant to go fuck himself and went home.

I had tracking on my shipment and apparently they were earlier than thought and dropped it off while i was away. So when i got home, no package could be found. Some fucking dickhead stole it because it was left on the porch and my bitch mom was at "work" so she couldn't take it. I sent a complained to amazon and re-ordered my goods and now i had to wait ANOTHER day before i could game again. This time i made sure mom was there to accept the package, while i was waiting with some "adult entertainment" in my bedroom.

Anyway, to make a long story short; consoles suck and PC is superior in every way.
